# My Portfolio

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to make a personal webpage with personal information, internal navigation, and links to my contact information and projects I have worked on. I learned how to encode style elements like the background image across the header and links hidden in clickable icons/images in css. I had initially tried to build the webpage from the ground up on my own, however after about 12 commits I realized it would be better to borrow code from previous activities and rework it to my needs. So, all the content in the files was deleted and restarted about halfway through my working on this project.
